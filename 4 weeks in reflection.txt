Year of Code Reflection # 2:

It's been a little over a month of year of code and it's going a lot differently than expected.
I've managed to accomplish a lot of small projects and I'm starting to feel pretty comfortable
with a lot of web development. I'm also starting to look into publishing some of these small
projects so I can track downloads and know that others are using what I'm making. I may create
my own website to continue to expand in this area. I experienced a little bit of a lull in
motivation this period but I still forced myself to code and now I find that it really relaxes
me to create some of the things i've been working on. This year I hopefully plan to

Learn lots of web dev
get pretty good with Javascripts and its variants
learn j query
learn php
start exploring app development
make this I can put in a portfolio

So far I've learned javascript. I'm in the process of learnign j query but its proving to be
difficult to practice in chrome extensions due to installion issues. I'm going to put sombrero
cat in the chrome store but I'm not quite sure that's something I want to show off. I really
need to work on my idea list so I can create some things that both inspire me, entertain me,
and arn't embaressing to show an employer.

Wish me luck!
