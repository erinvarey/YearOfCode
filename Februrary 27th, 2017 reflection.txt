I'm two months into the project and I'm really happy I've stuck with it. I'm not the best at
sticking to resolutions so now that I've formed the habit I'm glad I have it. The world of
programming is really intimidating and it feels like theres so much to learn and everyone is
super ahead of me. I've found that coding everyday has made me feel caught up. Another perk of
this project and partially with this time of year is that I've been focusing on professional
development. Making my own website, updating my Github, updating my Linkedin, and building a
portfolio having all been major focuses because of this. I have two years left of school
before I graduate but I like taking my time to do all the things I should have at that point
now. Should also help for future summer coops if I don't go back to my previous coop again 
next summer.
