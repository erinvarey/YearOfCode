Reflecting on 2 weeks of a year of code.

I've been pretty good with sticking to the resolution.
I've learned a lot and having to only do 15 minutes makes it a lot more manageable.
I find that I want to extend the time past the 15 minutes when I'm really into the code.
Hopefully this year I can learn a lot of webdev, app coding, and security in hopes of
one day being a better programmer.
